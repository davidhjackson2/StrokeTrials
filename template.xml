        <title>Effect of Clopidogrel Added to Aspirin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation</title>

        <res>randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo controlled trial</res>
        <res>primary outcome of any major vascular event or death</res>
        <res>secondary outcome stroke</res>
        <res>ASA 75-100mg + clopidogrel 75mg significantly reduced risk of composite primary outcome RR 0.89 (7.6 vs 6.8% events/year)</res>
        <res>Also reduced risk of any stroke RR 0.72 and ischemic stroke RR 0.68 (1.9 vs 2.8% events/year)</res>
        <res>Hemorrhagic stroke was nonsignificantly increased</res>
        <res>Bleeding complications of all types, except for fatal, were all significantly increased: Major (RR 1.57, events/year 1.3->2.0%), minor (RR 2.42, 3.5->1.4%), GI (RR 1.96, 0.5->1.1%), and ICH (RR 1.87, 0.2->0.4%)</res>
        <res>pts controlled for CHADS2 score, duration of Afib, h/o stroke</res>
        <lim>“unsuitable for coumadin” is not clearly defined and introduces potential selection bias</lim>
        <lim>13% pts had h/o stroke/tia, so can’t make recommendations specifically for primary or secondary prevention</lim>
        <lim>ARR of ischemic stroke only 0.9%, Attributable risk is 0.2% for ICH. This may sway some people to “pick their poison” opting for the minor benefit in ischemic stroke risk reduction at the cost of GI and minor bleeds</lim>
        <thm>In pts w/ Afib not suitable for warfarin, ASA + clopidogrel significantly decreases ischemic stroke risk and significantly increases minor->major bleeding risks compared to ASA monotherapy</thm>

        <title>Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus oral anticoagulation for atrial ﬁbrillation in the Atrial ﬁbrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for prevention of Vascular Events</title>
        <year>2006</year>
        <url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16765759</url>
        <res>randomized, open treatment w/ blinded adjucation of outcomes, controlled trial</res>
        <res>primary outcome of first occurrence of vascular event</res>
        <res>in pts w/ Afib, warfarin (annual risk 3.93%) is superior to ASA 75-100mg + clopidogrel 75mg (5.6%) for composite primary outcome</res>
        <res>among subgroups in the primary outcome, nondisabling strokes were significantly decreased, but disabling and fatal strokes were not</res>
        <res>especially in those already on oral anticoag w/ INR range 2-3.</res>
        <res>hemorrhagic stroke significantly increased from 0.12% to 0.36%, p=0.036</res>
        <res>difference in bleeding complications amongst the treatment and control groups were not significant</res>
        <res>the absolute difference in yearly % of hemorrghic stroke rate is less than that of ischemic stroke rate</res>
        <lim>the study was stopped early because of clear benefit of warfarin over ASA + clopidogrel</lim>
        <lim>the net benefit of primary outcome versus major hemorrhage was only significantly in favor of those already on oral anticoag upon entry into the study</lim>
        <thm>Warfarin is significantly superior to ASA + clopidogrel for preventing vascular complications in pts w/ Afib (especially non-disabling strokes in those already on anticoagulation) w/ no significant increase in bleeding complications</thm>
